# HGTransferUnderStrainCoexistence
These are the files of the python code to simulate evolution under directional selection acting on two strains, each carrying a neutral marker.
The file 2strains_4colors_gamma.py generates one simulation for a set of parameters. 
The file multiple_gamma_simulations.py that will call 2strains_4colors_gamma.py to perform a large set of parameters (which can be modified within the code)
The file final_heatmaps_figure.ipynb is a Jupiter notebook that will create heatmaps with the data simulated with the previous codes and compares its output with the experimental data. 
These files where produced by Manolo Mischler (manolo.mischler@gmail.com, please email him if needed)
